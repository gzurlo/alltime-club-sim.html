PRIORITIZED FIXES - Do in This Order:

1. Hall of Fame Auto-Population (CRITICAL - user complaint #1)
2. Season Mode Group Generation (CRITICAL - broken feature)  
3. Tournament Timeline (HIGH - visual bug)
4. Tournament History Display (HIGH - broken button)
5. Quick Tournament Undefined (MEDIUM - visual bug)
6. Prediction Buttons (MEDIUM - feature request)
7. Manager XP Display (check if already working)
8. Themes/UI improvements (LOWER priority)

Let me start with the CRITICAL issues first.
